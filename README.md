## Common Big-O run times
n = num of operations // time and space complexity based on growth   
- `O(1)` - constant time
- `O(log n)` - log time
- `O(n)` - linear time
- `O(n * log n)` - eg quicksort
- `O(n2)` - eg selection sort
- `O(n!)` - n factorial eg traveling salesperson

Linked lists vs. Arrays

Array
- contiguous Memory
- O(1) reading elements
- O(n) for insertion/deletion
- Memory size needs to be defined in advance

Linked List
- non-contiguous
- O(n) reading elements
- O(1) for insertion/deletion
